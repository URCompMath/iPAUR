### (image Processing Algorithms at University of Regensburg)

The code is implemented for my master thesis found in the **src/LaTex** folder.

## Requirements

### CUDA

For the use of the GPU implementation, [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) is needed.

### OpenCV

For reading and writing images [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) is needed.
